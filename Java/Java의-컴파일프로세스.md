# Java compilation process
24.02.27

- The source code of a Java code is compiled into an intermediate binary code known as the Bytecode during the Java compilation process. 
- The machine cannot directly execute this Bytecode. 
- A virtual machine known as the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, understands it. JVM includes a Java interpreter that converts Bytecode to target computer machine code. 
- JVM is platform-specific, which means that each platform has its own JVM. However, once the proper JVM is installed on the machine, **any Java Bytecode code can be run**. This is shown in the diagram below:
