# Is Java a Compiler or Interpreter Based Language?
24.02.27

When we talk about compilers we mean that- A tool that converts source code into machine language making it easier for the computer to interpret it is called a compiler.

Let’s have a look at the Java interpreter- As a compiler, an interpreter is also a programming tool that converts our source code into readable(for computers) machine code but it doesn't work in the same way that the compiler does. It converts each statement going through it thoroughly before moving on to the next one and then executes it. No executor is needed for an interpreter.

hence we can conclude that we can consider java to be both [compiler and interpreter](https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/difference-between-compiler-and-interpreter/) based language because the source code first gets compiled into binary code and then the same binary code runs on the JVm (Java Virtual Machine), and this is mostly a software-based interpreter

So since we have completely understood how the codes in java are executed let's sum up what we just read.
